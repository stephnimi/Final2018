            <p>Where convenient meets respoonsible. Auto Correct Mobile Steam is the most convenient and environmentally responsible service in auto detailing ever conceived. As opposed to traditional auto detailing, Auto Correct uses the natural cleaning and disinfecting power of steam to clean your vehicle. SJE Corp's Optima Steamer allows us to use the power of steam to clean the inside and outside of your vehicle using a fraction of the water that is normally required. The Optima Steamer uses a dry steam that is powerful enough to get professional results without using traditional chemicals.<p>
